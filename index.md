I am a graduate student from the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, Indiana University Bloomington ([HPS at IUB](https://hpsc.indiana.edu/)). I major in philosophy of science, with a minor in cognitive science. I love to study how traditional philosophical concepts and questions shape the development of scientific theories and practices, and how the progress in science conversely give new meanings to them.

<h1 id="Research Interests">Research Interests:</h1>

<br>
General philosophy of science: traditional topics like inference, confirmation, explanation, and scientific methodology.
<br>
Philosophy of special sciences: philosophical issues invigorated by fascinating scientific domains like machine learning, cognitive science, astronomy, and historical sciences.
<br>
Intellectual history of science: philosophy and science have been constantly shaping each other over the history, especially in periods of drastic social and intellectual transition. I am especially interested in Naturphilosophie (the German word that stands for both natural philosophy and some part of natural science at the time) of German Idealism (Kant and Schelling) and Romanticism (Goether).
